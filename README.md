## Project Overview

The Disaster Response Observation Network, more commonly known as DRON, is the student led project with the goal of aiding firefighters and first responders during large structural fires. The detailed information about the location, intensity and growth of fires is crucial to the proper response, and by improving the ability of first responders to actively respond to events, we intend to save lives. 

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
- Design and implement a drone with all sensors for autonomous flight and data aquisition.
- Collaberate between drones for decision making and obstacle detection.
- Communicate live data to the first responders in an easy to understand format.
